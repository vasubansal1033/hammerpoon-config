# hammerpoon-config
## My hammerspoon init.lua and spoons that I use

1. I am using SpoonInstall, TextClipboardHistory and ClipboardTool spoons right now
2. I also added a manual code for canvas, which displays hardcoded shortcuts specific to an app (if configured).
    - Binding is -> Ctrl + Alt + /
